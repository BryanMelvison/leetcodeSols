        # Iterative (my approach):
        # What I did was basically, take note of the parent-child relationship in a dictionary, then from it, I go bottom up approach to take note of the parents of each node, and then I find the first similar node across both tracked nodes, its O(n) but it also is O(n) space complexity
        # Time complexity, O(n) : We traverse each node once
        # Space complexity, O(n) : We store n nodes in the family_node and val_node dictionaries

        # Recursive (Classic Solution)

        # Time complexity, O(n) : We traverse each node once

        # Runtime: faster than 63.73%
        # Memory Usage: less than 87.28%.
